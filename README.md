# Fruit Tree Community Map

We are building an Android app that will let users find and map fruit trees around them.

This the final assignment in the course [Advanced Java Programing Workshop](https://www.openu.ac.il/courses/20503.htm) at The Open University of Israel.

### Tech Stack

Although Android apps tend to be written in Kotlin in our days, we wrote it in Java due to the subject of the course.
We used Google Sign-in as our login system, and used the FireStore database to store the data.
Google Maps API is obviously used to display the map and Android Studio is used as the IDE.
We used various tutorials and documentation to help us with the project, mainly from [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) and [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/start).


#### To run locally:

- add `MAPS_API_KEY` to `local.properties`
- add your SHA to firebase ([Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67460387/how-to-get-sha1-code-in-new-version-of-android-studio-4-2))
